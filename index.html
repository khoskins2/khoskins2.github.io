            I am an upcoming junior software engineer preparing the enter the workforce. 
            I am an accomplished coder with experience in a few different languages and 
            frameworks and I am excited to see what is coming up soon in the software 
            development industry. I enjoy using my skills to work on new technological 
            advances and to help people where I can. I recently graduated from Austin Peay 
            State University in December 2023 with a bachelor's degree in computer science 
            with a concentration in software engineering. I have worked on teams with 
            many different types of people and worked on a few projects both for school 
            and in my spare time. I am also a member of ACM (Association of Computing
            Machinery).
