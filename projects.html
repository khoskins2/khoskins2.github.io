            Emergency Class Manager is an interactive website that allows
            teachers and administration in the Clarksville-Montgomery County
            School System to keep track of students during emergency situations
            or drills.
          </h5>

            Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Vue.js, Vuetify, Supabase(Postgres)
          </h5>
          <h5>
            Teachers are able to mark students present or absent and send that
            information to administrators. Teachers can view events (drills) for
            the future as well as directly email administration, and update
            their account.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            Administration is able to do the same things as teachers, as well as
            some added features. They are able to create events (drills) as well
            as delete events for teachers to view. They can view reports from
            teachers as well as view users who are in the system. Administrators
            can also add students, delete students, add classes, and delete classes.
